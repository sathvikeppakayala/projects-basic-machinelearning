Welcome to the **projects-basic-machinelearning** repository! This repository showcases various basic machine learning projects aimed at helping beginners understand key concepts and techniques in machine learning.

## Current Project: Email Spam Classifier

### Overview

The Email Spam Classifier project is designed to automatically classify emails as "spam" or "not spam." Using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, this project provides a practical example of how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems.
