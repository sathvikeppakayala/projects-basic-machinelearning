# # Email Spam Filtering using Naive Bayes in machine learning
# ## we have taken a sample dataset available on internet which has spam and ham mails available at my gihub repository - Machine Learning @sathvikeppakayala
# ## the columns Available in dataset are
# ## my github - sathvikeppakayala
# - Messsage ID
# - message
# - spam/ham

# In[50]:

# # we use Naive Bayes 
# ## Naive Bayes are three types
# - Bernoulli Naive Bayes - used for only Binary 0, 1
# - Multinomial Naive Bayes - used for discrete data
# -  Guassian Naive Bayes - used for Nomal Distribution
# # We use Multinomial Naive Bayes as we Imported earlier
